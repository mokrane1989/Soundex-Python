The following is a Python version 3.5 implementation of the Soundex algorithm.

Soundex is a phonetic algorithm that was once used by the United States
Census Bureau in the 1930's to find similar names in census records from 
1890 to 1920. Since then, improved phonetic algorithms have been developed.
As such, treat this code as more of a novelty application rather than for
anything of importance.
